		<h2>Foxes</h2>
				<p> One of my favorite animal in the world are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox">foxes</a> are one of the most amazing creatures on the earth because they are cunning and graceful, endangered and have fantastic things that most people do not know about them. The red fox also one of the most endangered species on earth and can run up to around 30 mph. Foxes are described as cunning in many folklore such as The Fox and The Grapes and Another Little Red Hen. Many people do not know that arctic foxes do not shiver until -94 degrees fahrenheit. Also the smallest type of fox weighs under 3 pounds.

			<h2>The Giant Panda</h2>
				<p> My second favorite animal in the world is the <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda">giant panda</a>. Giant pandas are in the red list of the most endangered species on the world. There are only about 2000 pandas left on the world. Pandas are one of my favorite animals because they are going extinct. This may be the last chance for any of us to see a real panda. An interesting fact that most people do not know is that a Panda fur can be sold up to 100,000 dollars on the black market.
