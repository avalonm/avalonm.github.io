		<h2>My Skills</h2>
				<p>I can type around 55 wpm. I can also cook and bake I have good grades in school and my gpa has never dropped below 3.8. I work well in groups. When working on projects I am very dependable as well. I take a lot of work onto myself and also score very high on projects. I am very good at managing my time. I like to get my work done before I need to turn it in so that I have time to spot errors or have extra time for turning in another harder project. <br>
